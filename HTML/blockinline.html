<p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>
<p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

<p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
<p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>

<h1>The span element</h1>
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
